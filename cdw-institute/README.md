# Cognitive Discipline Workspace Institute

The Cognitive Discipline Workspace (CDW) Institute is a system for rigorous intellectual work that enforces manual control, epistemic rigor, and prevents automation. The system provides a structured environment with four spatial zones, each serving a distinct epistemic function, with the Table as the sole site of binding judgment.

## Foundational Constraints (IMMUTABLE)

These constraints govern every design decision. They are not guidelines. They are laws.

1. **The Table is the sole site of binding judgment.** No other zone may render verdicts, conclusions, or synthesized positions that carry epistemic weight.
2. **Side Desk, Reading Chair, and Shelves are strictly non-binding.** They may hold material, enable exploration, and support preparation—but they produce no conclusions.
3. **No automatic transitions between zones are permitted.** Material does not flow automatically from one zone to another. Every movement requires explicit Researcher action.
4. **All transitions require explicit Researcher action.** The system never moves, promotes, or archives content autonomously.
5. **No AI reasoning, recommendation, or synthesis features are allowed.** The system is a workspace, not an assistant. It holds, organizes, and displays. It does not think.
6. **Interdisciplinary comparison is provisional until judged at the Table.** Material from multiple disciplines may be juxtaposed anywhere, but such juxtaposition carries no epistemic weight until the Researcher renders judgment at the Table.

## Architecture

The system consists of four spatial zones:

- **The Table**: Site of active judgment and binding conclusion (capacity: 3-5 items)
- **The Side Desk**: Active preparation and marshaling space
- **The Reading Chair**: Exploratory engagement and contemplation
- **The Shelves**: Organized storage and retrieval
