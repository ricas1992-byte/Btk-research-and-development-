## Core Principle
The Cognitive Discipline Workspace enforces a simple rule: **judgment happens only at the Table**.

## The Four Zones

### The Table
Your judgment zone. Limited to 5 items. Everything here is "under judgment" until you render a verdict. Verdicts are binding and permanent.

**When to use**: When you are ready to make a final, binding decision about material you've been working with.

**Key actions**:
- Add items to the Table (requires explanation)
- Review items under judgment
- Render verdict with reasoning
- Remove items if not ready for judgment

### The Side Desk
Your preparation space. Organize and marshal material here before bringing it to the Table. Nothing here is binding.

**When to use**: When you're preparing arguments, organizing evidence, or queuing items for future judgment.

**Key actions**:
- Stage items for eventual Table judgment
- Reorder and organize provisionally
- Prepare supporting materials

### The Reading Chair
Your exploration space. Read, annotate, make connections. Everything here is provisional. Take your time.

**When to use**: Initial engagement with sources, exploratory reading, making tentative connections.

**Key actions**:
- Add new items for exploration
- Create provisional annotations
- Make tentative observations
- Explore interdisciplinary connections

### The Shelves
Your storage. Categorize and retrieve. Holds both your raw materials and your finalized judgments.

**When to use**: Long-term storage of both source materials and completed Table Records.

**Key actions**:
- Archive finalized TableRecords
- Store reference materials by category
- Retrieve past judgments
- Organize by topic or discipline

## Key Rules
1. **Only the Table can produce binding judgments**
   No other zone may render verdicts or conclusions that carry epistemic weight.

2. **You must explain every transition between zones**
   The system requires you to state why you're moving each item. This is not optional.

3. **The system will never move things for you**
   No automation. No suggestions. No smart features. You are in complete control.

4. **The system will never suggest or recommend**
   This is a workspace, not an assistant. It holds and organizes. It does not think.

5. **Your verdicts are final**
   Once you render a binding judgment at the Table, it cannot be edited. This is by design.

## Workflow Example

1. **Add sources to Reading Chair**
   Import research materials, articles, notes. Status: provisional.

2. **Explore and annotate (provisional)**
   Read, make notes, explore connections. Everything remains provisional.

3. **Move promising material to Side Desk**
   When material seems relevant to a judgment you're forming, stage it at the Side Desk.
   Required: Explain why you're moving it.

4. **Organize at Side Desk for judgment**
   Arrange evidence, structure arguments, prepare for confrontation.

5. **Bring to Table (max 5 items)**
   When ready for judgment, move items to the Table.
   Required: Explain why each item belongs on the Table.
   Status changes to: under-judgment.

6. **Render verdict with reasoning**
   The core epistemic action. State your verdict and provide your reasoning.
   Required: Explicit confirmation that this judgment is binding and final.
   Creates: TableRecord (immutable, binding).

7. **Archive to Shelves**
   Move finalized items and TableRecords to Shelves for long-term storage.
   Organize by category for future reference.

## Important Notes

- The Table has a capacity of 5 items. This is not a technical limitation—it's an epistemic constraint. Judgment requires focused confrontation.

- You cannot bypass the transition dialog. Every move between zones requires explicit researcher justification.

- TableRecords are read-only. Once created, they cannot be edited. This is the nature of binding judgment.

- The system logs all your actions in an immutable audit log. You can review this log to understand your research process.

- If you violate a system constraint, you'll receive a clear error message explaining why. The system will never silently fail or auto-correct.
